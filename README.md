# Mod Randomizer
[Get this extension on the opera addons store](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/mod-randomizer/)

This is a mod randomizer for Opera GX, so you don't have to manually disable and then choose which mod to enable.

Just click on randomize, and you're done. You can manually switch mods like this, but it's possible to automate it with the other options: you can randomize when browser restarts, and randomize periodically. 
You can customize which mods will be disabled and enabled, based on the mod's in the current profile.
