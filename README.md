# Mod Randomizer
[Get this extension on the opera addons store](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/mod-randomizer/)

This is a mod randomizer for Opera GX, so you don't have to manually disable and then choose which mod to enable.

Just click on randomize, and you'll be redirected to enable/reinstall the mod, depending on your preference. 

Reinstall enables all checkmarks, so it's recommended to keep it on. 

You can manually switch mods like this, but it's possible to automate it with the other options: you can randomize when browser restarts, and randomize periodically. 

You can customize which mods will be disabled and enabled, using the mod profiles.
