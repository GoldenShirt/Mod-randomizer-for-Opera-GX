# Mod Randomizer
[Get this extension on the opera addons store](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/mod-randomizer/)

This is a mod randomizer for Opera GX, so you don't have to manually disable and then choose which mod to enable.

Just click on randomize, and you're done. You can manually switch mods like this, but this also works when you start opera if you enable "Randomize on OperaGX startup".

You can customize which mods will be disabled and enabled.
If you want this extension to not disable some of the mods it detected, disable the automatic mod identification, and then uncheck the undesired mods and save.
