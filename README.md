This is a mod randomizer for Opera GX, so you don't have to manually disable and then choose which mod to enable.

Just click on automatic mod identification, and you're done. You can click randomize to manually switch mods, but this also works when you start opera.

If you want this extension to not disable some of the mods it detected, disable the automatic mod identification, and then uncheck the undesired mods and save.

(Disclaimer: I only know very basic coding so most of this was made by Aria, yes the AI.)
